# getDisplayMedia-silent-meet-stream
Reproduces the bug where starting a capture via getDisplayMedia mutes the stream sound on certain websites

- Start a recording from any tab playing sounds, something like music.youtube.com, observe how the tab's sound is being properly recorded
- Start a recording from meet.google.com, observe how the recorded stream is silent
